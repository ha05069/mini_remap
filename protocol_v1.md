# Rapid Learning and Guideline Validation in COVID 19



## Proposal

An embedded multifactorial trial designed to rapidly evaluate implemented clinical guidelines in the management of critically ill patients with CV19.

## Background

CV19 represents a novel disease process with a high requirement for multiple critical care interventions.  The rapidity of the emerging caseload has required rapid and flexible adoption of guidelines to aid management of these patients.  These guidelines, for the most part have been based on evidence derived from similar conditions such as Adult Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS).  There is emerging anecdotal and observational evidence that some of the multiple interventions within these guidelines may not represent optimal care in this new scenario.  Therefore we propose a structured research framework to evaluate aspects of CV19 treatment.  

### Clinical Scenario

Current guidelines at UCH (Figure 1) recommend proning the patient following initial intubation if they are unable to reach target oxygen saturations of 88-92% and have a PaO2:FiO2 ratio (PFR) of < 27 kPa.  There is also an accompanying statement that episodic proning (16 hours per day) may have to be continued for up to seven days.  It is not clear whether subsequent proning should be conducted on the basis of the above SpO2 and PFR criteria or whether there would still be benefit derived from proning at a higher PFR.  It is also unclear if this threshold of PFR < 27 kPa is optimal in COVID 19 patients.  Clinicians may decide to initiate proning at an earlier stage when these measures are more favourable as there are emerging reports of benefits with earlier proning.  As a result, variation in practice exists both within single institutions and also between different hospitals.   

What we do not have is a robust mechanism for capturing scenarios where clinicians deviate from established guidance in order to learn from these instances.  We propose to exploit specific moments of clinical equipoise to encourage senior clinicians to submit their patient for randomisation to a particular stratified intervention where they are uncertain of the benefits of the intervention. 

For example, in the above scenario of whether or not to initiate proning, clinicians may be presented with the scenario at the beginning of a shift of whether or not to prone a patient during that shift.  If the clinician retains equipoise about whether the patient should be proned or not, they may elect to contribute to the study by entering the patient forward for randomisation assuming there are no contraindications to the intervention.   If eligible the patient can then be randomised to proning or not given their PFR at that point in time.  

Setting:

UK Critical Care Units participating in DECOVID study.

Population:

Patients with confirmed CV19.  Aged > 18 years old.



Study Questions:

1. Is there benefit from early proning at a lower P/F ratio?
   1. Hypothesis:  Early intervention with proning at a PFR > 27 decreases FiO2 requirements in following 16 hours and is associated with decreased time to extubation and improved 30 day mortality.



Design:

Multicentre, pragmatic, randomised controlled, unblinded trial to determine whether early proning versus usual standard of care improves short term outcomes such as oxygenation and long term outcomes such as successful extubation and mortality within 30 days.  

Patients with respiratory failure secondary to COVID 19 requiring intubation and mechanical ventilation, who have not been proned during their admission so far will be eligible for randomisation.  

Randomisation will remain at the discretion of the two senior clinicians responsible for management of the patient across consecutive day and night shifts. 

At the time of handover from day to night shift, the consultants will discuss the individual perceived benefit of initiating proning during that shift given the current clinical status of the patient.  If both parties have equipoise regarding the utility of initiating proning vs. not then they may elect to progress the patient to randomisation.  The patient will subsequently be randomised to proning at a given P/F ratio.  If during the course of the shift, the target P/F ratio is realised then the patient will be proned or not based on the outcome of the randomisation process.   



General Background:

Multiple clinical guidelines have been formulated to direct care of critically ill CV19 patients.  The evidence base for these interventions, in this unique disease setting is virtually non-existent.  Therefore guidelines are transplanted from existing evidence and clinical acumen from decades of treating similar conditions such as ARDS.  As clinicians are exposed to more cases, they accrue experiential knowledge of the success or failure of these guidelines in individual circumstances and in some cases will deviate from clinical guidelines in individual circumstances.  Currently there is no research framework which is able to capture the ramifications of these individual deviations in a format which can be learned from at an institutional or national level.  

Therefore we propose a multicentre study to evaluate treatment interventions specific to the management of critically ill CV19 patients.  The study will use a presumed consent model to capture and evaluate situations where clinicians experience equipoise towards a particular intervention.  

Worked example: Proning 

Currently consultants will hand over patients twice a day (day and night shifts).  At handover the day's events, progress and current status are discussed.  This handover often generates new aims and targets for the subsequent shift to implement.  This is an opportunity to exploit these changes in a structured research setting.  For example, a patient may have been requiring 65% oxygen throughout the day shift.  The current clinical guideline might recommend proning when the FiO2 reaches 70%.  However, the two clinicians may share equipoise about whether proning would be beneficial at the lower FiO2 currently in place.  They may then choose to prone (or not) either complying with or disregarding the clinical guidelines.  In this situation there is no good evidence for proning at one particular FiO2 versus the other.  We propose that the two senior clinicians be invited to randomise their approach to making this decision allowing the short term outcomes of the decision to be observed and learned from in rigorous format.
